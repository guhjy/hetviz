Description: A graphical user interface for the visualization of
    treatment effect heterogeneity, including tables and plots that may
    be helpful in determining the presence of heterogeneity and the
    covariates that define the subgroups across which the treatment
    effect varies systematically. The interface is powered by RStudio's
    Shiny web application framework and works with data provided in a
    prespecified structure.
